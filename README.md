## Futures

<ul>
<li>user can register and login her account.</li>
<li>light/dark mood.</li>
<li>fully responsive.</li>
<li>user can create task.</li>
<li>when user select Priority high he can see a star in her task corner. I mean this task will be important for his.</li>
<li>dashboard for maintaining " Team, Project, Task managment " etc.</li>

</ul>

## What not done

<ul>
<li>team task managment.</li>
<li>task delete and edit functionality.</li>
<li>dashboard functionality.</li>
<li>filtering and sorting.</li>

</ul>

### The reason I haven't been able to finish them is because I'm completely focused on design for front-end development and I can also do functionality but a bit. I want to learn more functionality and I think I can get a chance for it.
